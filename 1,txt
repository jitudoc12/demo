Keep in mind that using the API might involve some limitations, and you should review OpenAI's documentation for more details and best practices.

Please note that the GPT-3.5 codebase is proprietary to OpenAI, and only certain parts of it are made available through their API. If you're looking for the underlying architecture details or the full source code, it is not publicly available.
